## Memory error detection

- [AddressSanitizer]() : AddressSanitizer (or ASan) is an open source programming tool by Google that detects memory corruption bugs such as buffer overflows or accesses to a dangling pointer (use-after-free). AddressSanitizer is currently implemented in Clang (starting from version 3.1) , GCC (starting from version 4.8) and Xcode (starting from version 7.0)

- [Fault-localization](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/kevinb22/fault-localization-research) : Implementations of two fault localization tools (GZoltar and Tarantula),
as well as a test program (Triangle).

## Invariant inference

- [Daikon](https://github.com/codespecs/daikon/) :  implementation of dynamic invariant detection. Daikon runs a program, observes the values that the program computes, and then reports properties that were true over the observed executions, and thus likely true over all executions.
